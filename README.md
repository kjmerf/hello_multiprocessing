# hello multiprocessing

The purpose of the repo is to try out Python's multiprocessing library.
We will use the library to calculate the stopping time of integers plugged into the function defined by the collatz conjecture.
To execute the program, simply pass the number of integers you want to run the ```main.py``` file like this:
```python main.py --numbers=1000`
